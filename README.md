# Bluray 

*A simple bluray creation script.*

UDF is a great filesystem, but some GUI tools are unreliable.
This simple Zenity/bash script reliably creates single or multilayer UDF bluray discs. 

*Requirements*

This script requires zenity, udftools & cdrecord v3.01+. 
It has been tested on several Ubuntu Xenial machines with cdrecord v3.02.
